# Alternatives, Inspiration and Comparisons

What inspired **Simplicity**, how it compares to other alternatives and what it learned from them.

## Intro

**Simplicity** wouldn't exist if not for the previous work of others.

There have been many tools created before that have helped inspire its creation.

## Previous tools

### cookiecutter-pypackage

This is the progenitor of Python package templates, designed to work for everyone. The lessons learned from this project is to focus on the standards of the day and work towards them rather than inventing something new.

### cookiecutter-django

I started this project with the intention of building a tool that works for everyone. It taught me to not accept PRs or work from people bringing in new tech I don't understand without a history with me of maintaining their efforts.

### Pipenv

The lesson of pipenv (and some other tools) is that pip, venv, and other "standard" tools are good foundations to build on.

### Poetry

Sometimes it's good to go off in your own direction, to reinvent the wheel. Poetry taught me to be okay with reinventing the wheel of package templating one more time.
